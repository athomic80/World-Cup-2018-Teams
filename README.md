## 💭 Reflection 📝
- Working on this project has been an exciting journey! Here’s a quick reflection on my experience:

### Data Collection & Cleaning 🧹:

- The data for this project was sourced from Excel spreadsheets, which made organizing the tournament data relatively simple. However, ensuring the data was clean and properly structured was an important first step to ensure accuracy in analysis. I spent a good amount of time ensuring the player stats and team performance details were consistent across different datasets.

#### Power BI Insights 🔥:

- Creating the Power BI dashboards was a great learning experience. I was able to visualize trends, like the performance of top teams and players over the tournament, in an interactive and visually appealing way. The challenge was balancing between too much information and providing useful, digestible insights. But once I found the right balance, it was really rewarding to see the data come to life in a dynamic format.

#### Key Learnings 📚:

- I learned how to integrate Excel data with Power BI to create informative visualizations.
- I practiced data analysis using Python, gaining hands-on experience working with real-world sports data.
- I also sharpened my skills in structuring and organizing large datasets to ensure they can be easily analyzed.

#### Challenges ⚔️:

- One of the challenges was ensuring that all the data from different countries and teams was properly formatted. Some datasets had inconsistent columns, so I spent time cleaning and transforming the data to make sure it was suitable for analysis.
- Creating meaningful and insightful visuals in Power BI was another challenge. I wanted the visuals to be engaging but also easy to understand. Balancing these two aspects took some trial and error.

#### What's Next? 🚀:

- In the future, I’d like to add more advanced analysis to the project, such as results data. Additionally, I’d love to expand the project by including data from other tournaments to build a broader dataset for further exploration.
- This project has been a great way to combine my passion for football with data analysis. I look forward to expanding it further and using what I've learned in future data projects! 🎉⚽
